title: Hello Jekyll
layout: posts

I swore I wouldn't make a blog until I had things to write about, but I'm also trying to learn how Jekyll works, so here we are.

You are probably here because you saw the link to my website on one of my other social media profiles, because you are one of my friends, or because your name is also Kiana and you were Googling yourself.

In any case, hello. Here are some things about me:

* I'm a recent (under)graduate of Brandeis University, where I got my B.S. in Computer Science with minors in Classical Studies and Medieval and Renaissance Studies.
* I'm a current graduate student, still at Brandeis, this time getting my M.A.T. in Secondary Mathematics with a not-so-sneaky plan to teach computer science at the high school level.
* When I'm not doing either of those things, I'm a jack-of-all-trades software engineer. Currently I'm working for the Brandeis MakerLab doing web development. I also freelance.
* When I was an undergrad, I founded Codestellation: The Friendly Hackathon with some friends. I still work on this through the MakerLab.
* I play bass viola da gamba, which is basically a Renaissance cello with frets. You can see this in action during the academic year, when I play with the Brandeis Early Music Ensemble.

As the year moves on I'm hoping I can use this platform to talk about my journey and development as a teacher, my perspective as a woman in tech, and other musings as a twenty-something with a borderline manic set of interests. Check back in when you like, and thanks for taking the time.
